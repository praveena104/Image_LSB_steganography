# Image_LSB_steganography
This project implements Image Steganography using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) mechanism in C language. It allows users to hide secret text messages within a BMP image by altering the least significant bits of pixel data. The hidden information is retrievable only with a secret key shared between the sender and receiver.
